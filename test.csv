"12","italy, germany","Well, if you want to attack France in the Mediterranean while I attack through Burgundy you can have Marseille and Iberia while I take Brest and Paris, then with France out of the way you could focus on Turkey or Austria.

"12","italy, austria","I'd personally rather you didn't, because a play around Munich is also a play around Trieste and Vienna.

"12","italy, turkey","I may be able to hit Tri in the fall, which would cut it's ability to support Ven, by the way.

I'm guessing you're ordering into Trieste anyway to protect Serbia while you take Greece with Bulgaria and Aegean. So the question is what is ion doing?","italy","turkey","True","True","486","6","1903","Fall","4","-1"

"12","italy, turkey","Any other arrangement opens me for a stab and sets us up for conflict. Tunis is better for you than Naples, and it's a lot better for me to have you there with a path forward than tied up with me. If you feel bad about it, support me to Trieste","italy","turkey","True","True","490","10","1903","Fall","4","-1"
"12","italy, turkey","Ok, that's totally sensible logic.  I may end up having to pass up on Greece and catch it next year.  I can support you into Trieste, if you'd rather have that than retaking Venice, sure.","turkey","italy","True","True","491","11","1903","Fall","5","1"

So, what's the plan from here?  How far are you planning on riding that juggernaut?","italy","turkey","True","True","535","19","1903","Winter","4","-5"

"12","italy, turkey","Yeah, I wasn't seeing any response from you, so I moved to defend.  We're having some communication issues based on mis-timing, I think.  Cost us most of a turn, but we have the weekend to work out a way forward, nu?","italy","turkey","True","False","590","25","1904","Fall","4","-5"
"12","italy, turkey","Sure, understood.  How about this to fix it: Tys S Tun-Wes, Ion-Tun?  You take back a dot, but we push the position forwards toward Iberia?","turkey","italy","False","True","595","26","1904","Fall","9","5"
"12","italy, turkey","are you still not getting any messages from me?","turkey","italy","True","True","601","27","1904","Fall","9","5"

"12","italy, turkey","Ok, France has told me outright they're wanting to make sure that ""Italy is divided fairly"", so I doubt they'll expect me pushing past you toward the west.","turkey","italy","True","True","616","31","1904","Fall","9","5"
"12","italy, turkey","Looks that way, yes","italy","turkey","True","True","633","32","1904","Fall","4","-5"
"12","italy, turkey","It's too bad we can't find a way to work together to force me out into MAO, instead of whittling down your defenses season by season.

"12","italy, turkey","Yeah.  For this season, there’s no point in trying to negotiate something: the risk is too high for you on a fall turn.

So I’m game to try and out guess them with you, but I think Russia is looking for an ally anywhere.  If you offered an alliance with them (real or fake) they would probably take it.  For example if you offered to convoy to Den while they drop into Bal, they’d probably do that, setting off an R/G war (not sure if you want that, but you could).","turkey","england","False","True","181","14","1901","Fall","3","0"

"4","austria, turkey","Sure, that makes sense. Like I said, first thing would be  to keep Russia out of RUM, whether that be by supporting yours or my army in.

"4","austria, turkey","Just confirming that you will support my BUL army into Rum this season?

"4","austria, turkey","No problem, I will support you into Greece. If you can attack gal to cut the support there and support me in rum that would be great. All going well we get one each.

Whichever one you take, I can't give up any of the others. I would be too far onto the back foot with you getting a freebe in the North and Austria seemingly coming for me. 1902 will be a big year and if we work this out and we play it as allies then we can both have a lot of trust going into next year which will  be really valuable.","turkey","russia","True","NOANNOTATION","248","17","1901","Fall","3","-1"

"4","russia, turkey","You're funny. Why is giving up Sev ""way too dangerous? It's not like me having it gives me access to very much of your territory... it is Russian territory after all. You are already a very powerful country, and if you do as I suggest, moving into Gre and Serbia, you could have nine supply centers. If you give me Sev, I will support you into Bud","russia","turkey","False","False","949","68","1903","Fall","5","-1"

Sev - Rum","russia","turkey","False","True","950","69","1903","Fall","5","-1"
"4","russia, turkey","Sev is too dangerous because Sev to Arm together with your ally Italy by sea and its basically and I just lost Austria as an ally. In the short-term then you have 3 to attack RUM with. Also, you think I can hold off you, Italy and Austria at the same time? I don't, not without SEV and not after giving up the ION as you're suggesting. Also, why would I be giving up ION in this scenario anyway if not to allow your ally Italy to come back at me by sea. And I don't know where you get 9 from? 6 + 2 - 1 = 7 then you're really going to support me into RUM in the fall *as well* as the 2 I got from Austria? So you get 1 and I get 3, that's really the deal you're happy with? Still totals to 8 by the way but we both know you have no intention of supporting me into RUM in the Fall. You will be attacking RUM with 3 while Italy tries to push through by sea. It doesn't take a genius to see that. Next time try and suggest a deal that actually has some appearance of sincerity otherwise it's just too easy to see through.","turkey","russia","True","True","952","70","1903","Fall","6","1"
"4","russia, turkey","Well... that was harsh. Let me just put a few things straight. Me and Italy is not a thing. I communicated with them the first year about a potential mid game alliance, as I didn't want to be the only one fighting you and Austria. But if you look at their moves, we haven't really done any work together. We haven't even communicated in years. If you look at what they have done so far, you'll see that they are a.) a very bad player or/and b.) are not at all committed to the game. They have basically communicated with nobody, haven't really attacked anyone, and had a good amount of invalid orders. At this point it doesn't make any sense for me to communicate with Italy, since they are a bad player and are going downhill fast. An alliance with you would be much better.","russia","turkey","False","True","989","71","1904","Spring","6","0"
"4","russia, turkey","If what you say about you and Austria not having an alliance anymore is true, then it looks like you don't have any friends at all close to you.

We are both strong countries, and a war would basically mean both of us getting put out of the game","russia","turkey","False","True","990","72","1904","Spring","6","0"
"4","russia, turkey","For the record, I don't think you can hold off me, Austria, and Italy at the same time. Definitely not.

"4","russia, turkey","And one last thing. If everything happened like I said we should do it, you would have 8; 6 + 1(serbia) + 1(greece) + 1(bulgaria) -1(sev). But that doesn't mean I only get one.

"4","russia, turkey","So, I'm still up for an alliance. I think it would be in both of our best interests, and could be very powerful"" But you need to stop constantly saying shit like""oh we never really worked it out"" or ""oh, I'm sorry it was too close to the adjudication period"", and then completely running over my ideas as soon as I say them.

"4","russia, france","If they do, should we work together too take them out?

"4","russia, france","So, just by the board position we have two options.
1. Take Holland and North Sea from England this turn. I would bounce Italy out of Munich and you would get a build, presumably a fleet in St Petersburg.
2. We don't attack England since he's been a very reliable ally, and commit fully to the attack on Italy and Turkey. This would look like sending all of my fleets south, so it would mean losing the option to efficiently attack England later, and also potentially leave us open to being stabbed by England.","france","russia","True","True","1071","188","1904","Spring","6","0"

"4","russia, france","So, if I'm going to be completly honest here(something that doesn't often happen in this game 🙃), I'm a little bit worried about you getting a few more supply centres and running off with the game. You took Munich from me, and then also two of italys. Nine supply centres and a good position. A little bit disturbing, if you can understand. And no, this doens't mean I'm calling off our alliance, or teaming up with enland,(that would be stupid of me as they are completely stranded).  So we are both strong countries, and could probably get away with a two way win, but are you at all interested in that?","russia","france","True","True","1185","218","1905","Spring","7","-2"
"4","russia, france","True. If we do it right, a fall stab should be unpreventable even if England does suspect something.","france","russia","True","True","1188","219","1905","Spring","9","2"
"4","russia, france","I appreciate you bringing up concerns: I would definitely be interested in a two-way win. It might be comforting to know that the supply center gap is absolutely temporary as Italy and Austria will work together to push me out of both Rome and Naples (not to mention, the fact that it ties up 4-5 of my units just to the Italian front). That on top of getting you a build this year should even things out, if not put things in your favor.","france","russia","False","False","1189","220","1905","Spring","9","2"

"4","russia, france","We should both keep talking to england; maybe suggest some orders that would make our attack more effective","russia","france","True","True","1191","222","1905","Spring","7","-2"
"4","russia, france","True. Just to be safe, it would be a good idea to dislodge the north Sea and prevent any convoys. It's going to mean England will know what's up, but I think our attack is unstoppable anyway. I think I can do this with just Belgium and English Channel","france","russia","True","True","1192","223","1905","Spring","9","2"

"4","russia, france","Ok sounds good.

"4","russia, france","So you moved to the North Sea. What gives?","france","russia","True","True","1231","232","1905","Winter","12","3"
"4","russia, france","Yeah last minute I decided that was a better position, since one of us should probalby occupy it, and it also has access to denmark. I hope that's ok and doesn't come accross as agressive. I will totally move out of there next turn if u ask me too, since you have more fleets that need to get out into the sea","russia","france","True","True","1236","233","1905","Winter","9","-3"
"4","russia, france","But I think that turn went amazing; I got rum from austria, and bounced in sev. Looks like you did pretty well too. I think if we continue this alliance, we could totally win","russia","france","True","True","1237","234","1905","Winter","9","-3"
"4","russia, france","I think I will go with an army in warsaw, instead of a fleet in Stp, since I broke off the relationship with austria, and england doesn't seem like a threat. IS that good with you or would you preffer me to build in Stp, to get Enland out of the game quickly?","russia","france","True","True","1238","235","1905","Winter","9","-3"
"4","russia, france","Cool- we might be better off with you in the North Sea actually since it opens up the option to convoy to the island next turn. It depends somewhat on English disbands. Warsaw is fine with me- I agree with your logic, and we probably have enough units for England anyway","france","russia","True","True","1240","236","1905","Winter","12","3"

And why in the world would you need Austria to work with you against turkey? You're overrunning the map, and turkey is probably the least of your concern right now. If you didn't want this too be a betrayal, you could have told me and worked something out beforehand. And yes, I have a build(s) on my hand, but unless you actually do as you say, and move out of my centers, I won't really have a chance for winning.

I would have 100% proposed this beforehand, but I felt that the plan might be jeapordized if you weren't fully on board.

"4","england, france","I'm very happy to see your moves. Whild convoying London to Denmark is tempting, I think it makes the most sense to send Skaggerak to Denmark for two reasons.","france","england","True","True","428","56","1902","Fall","6","2"
"4","england, france","Firstly, Russia is the only thing preventing Turkey and Austria from rapid expansion, which is something we need to prevent in case either of them get in a dominant position in the east to the point of soloing, or being too big to take out in the future.","france","england","True","True","429","57","1902","Fall","6","2"
"4","england, france","Secondly, a fleet in Denmark can support a fleet from the North Sea into the Helgoland Blight, which is important in case Holland tries to bounce that move. Getting that fleet there is necessary if we hope to take Holland or Kiel in the future.","france","england","True","True","430","58","1902","Fall","6","2"
"4","england, france","By the way, pretty much everything I've told Germany this turn is a lie. Just so you know","france","england","True","False","449","59","1902","Fall","6","2"
"4","england, france","Can you move your Brest fleet down south? I'd prefer not to leave my backdoor unlocked, and nothing I have will be able to capitalize on that. That said, I'll be moving into Denmark","england","france","True","True","451","60","1902","Fall","4","-2"
"4","england, france","Are you comfortable if it goes to Picardy again? I want to try and corner Belgium.","france","england","True","True","460","61","1902","Fall","6","2"
"4","england, france","Germany is insisting that you told him that you'd attack me next, which is concerning since I am a logical target, and it's ""pretty much everything"" is a lie","england","france","True","True","461","62","1902","Fall","4","-2"
"4","england, france","Depends.","england","france","True","True","462","63","1902","Fall","4","-2"
"4","england, france","Look. You helped me out a ton last turn my moving out of the English Channel and building the fleet in Edinburgh. Meanwhile, Germany built 2 armies, used them against me to take a dot from me (I have a disband this turn), and tried to take Picardy. I'm not going to forget that.

I'm not going to attack you right now. And despite how difficult it is to predict the future in this game, I honestly don't see myself attacking you in the future either. Germany is the largest threat to me right now, and I can't overextend against you without worrying about Italy who has a fleet in Rome (which can only move West).","france","england","True","False","466","64","1902","Fall","6","2"
"4","england, france","Not to mention. You have a build coming and I have a disband. There's no chance I can win in a fight against you. Germany is trying to show discord between us because he knows it's the only chance he has to survive if we start working together. And for the record, I told him I'd be attacking you right now *if and only if* he gives me Belgium (this is a lie, but I'm hoping that I can snag Belgium this turn). I did not say anything about attacking you after splitting up Germany (and in general I like to deal with the present situation instead of making long-term plans, since the board is constantly changing).

I'll be around to talk more later today, but hopefully that assuaged some of your fears","france","england","True","True","467","65","1902","Fall","6","2"
"4","england, france","Okay. I will continue to support you against Germany. However, I will only accept Brest into Picardy if MAO moves south. You have other things to worry about, but I'm not going to open up my coasts without an insurance policy. I will move into Denmark, ideally with Russian support, and we can see how the situation progresses from there.","england","france","True","True","468","66","1902","Fall","4","-2"

"4","england, france","I will 100% do that if that is what we want to do. I don't mean to push it too much (as I realize just Picardy is a large trust excersize), but in the interest of full disclosure, I was initially planning to send MAO to the English Channel. I wanted to put that on the table as a way to get 3 units on Belgium. If Germany plays his cards correctly there is a high chance I lose Ruhr, and that will make it hard to take Belgium. Again, I know it's a huge ask, so right now I'm sending MAO south unless you allow me to put it in the channel temporarily. If you do allow that, you would have control over what we do with that unit- whether that's convoying London to Belgium, cutting Belgium support to try and capture Holland, or sending it to Belgium with supports from Burgundy and Picardy.","france","england","True","True","471","68","1902","Fall","6","2"
"4","england, france","I can see why you'd want MAO in EC. As a compromise, you can keep MAO where it is instead of moving south, and maybe EC next. Picardy and EC are two big bites, and being able to take them one at a time would go far in my comfort with that move.","england","france","True","True","472","69","1902","Fall","4","-2"

The fact of the matter is that I am surrounded by powers who can stab me with devastating effect (you) or powers who have in fact stabbed me (Russia) or would stab if given the chance (Germany). I am more than willing to hit Germany right now and move South from Denmark, but I also need to cover my bases and get Nor.

"4","turkey, france","I was floating the idea of a 3 way draw between you, Russia, and I, since it would make sense if we pulled it off correctly.","france","turkey","True","True","1415","71","1906","Fall","12","6"
"4","turkey, france","Up to you guys really. I will probably just try and be a pain for whoever is getting close to the solo by helping the other. I would therefore be happy to take the draw instead.","turkey","france","True","True","1416","72","1906","Fall","6","-6"
"4","turkey, france","Looks like you should be able to take it out anyway though. Russia has been playing some sub-par moves so the solo is there for you to take.","turkey","france","True","True","1417","73","1906","Fall","6","-6"
"4","turkey, france","With the English freebies its pretty much done.","turkey","france","True","True","1418","74","1906","Fall","6","-6"

"4","turkey, france","What do you mean there's no solo in sight? lol you're on 15 and there are three free centres in England... I might not be paying much attention to this game but I'd have to be blind and dumb not to see that. Even if there weren't freebies there you could get them elsewhere. You'd have to try harder not to solo from here haha","turkey","france","True","True","1432","78","1907","Spring","7","-8"
"4","turkey, france","Sure, it's definitely possible. That being said, I also think it would be inconvenient to take English supply Centers due to the density of those units","france","turkey","True","False","1433","79","1907","Spring","15","8"
"4","turkey, france","Regarding the three way, the best way to do it would probably be to force Austria off the map this turn. Maybe Bulgaria-Serbia with support from Rumania while Russia supports Galicia to Budapest?","france","turkey","True","True","1437","80","1907","Spring","15","8"
"4","turkey, france","The only issue would be a retreat to Greece or Albania, so it might be worthwhile to bounce in Albania with Greece and Ion to prevent any retreats","france","turkey","True","True","1439","81","1907","Spring","15","8"
"4","turkey, france","Interesting, I didn't mean to take Naples- I figured you might cut the Tyrhenian Sea's support. I'll move out if we can call a truce in Trieste?","france","turkey","False","True","1498","82","1907","Spring","15","8"
"4","turkey, france","Interesting choice to move to Albania as it means that Turkey can retreat to Greece","france","turkey","True","True","1500","83","1907","Spring","15","8"

"4","turkey, france","This game is over, spending more than 2 minutes per season is a waste of time. I'm glad you found the moves interesting though! I cant stop laughing at ""I didn't mean to take Naples"". In my experience, the best way not to take something is to not attack it. That's just what I've found but I guess you've got other methods of not taking something haha, of course you meant to take Naples and of course we both know that this game has been over for a few seasons. It's all the same at this point. Good game, well played. If you're trying to rack up lies with me I wouldn't bother. I have to conclude that that's the only point for all of them the last few seasons or is it just for fun? If its just for fun, carry on, I dont mind. If its for the successful lie counter, Russia is a better option for that I think?","turkey","france","True","True","1518","85","1907","Spring","7","-8"
"4","turkey, france","Well. I was trying to get you to not take Trieste in the fall. I can support it to hold, but I suspect that if you and Russia are coordinating, Vienna would cut Tyrolia's support.","france","turkey","True","False","1520","86","1907","Spring","15","8"
